Ludovic and Rory confirmed that more corporate contacts are requesting Weavy, with Rory noting it's \"the only tool that's been universally accepted at the corporate level.\" The timing follows Adobe's pivot toward nodal workflows, with Chrissie praising founders Itay and Lior for building a great product that \"genuinely deserved this.\"",
