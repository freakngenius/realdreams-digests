The release generated massive excitement across the community, with Alex noting \"I was in the zone my prompts are fire and then I realized I was actually using nano pro.\" The model became available across multiple platforms simultaneously: InVideo offered unlimited access for a year (described by Kēkā as \"eating a major part of their marketing budget\"), while Freepik initially provided unlimited access for Pro accounts before switching to tiered limits (1K, 2K, 4K) within 30 minutes, causing Jordan Daniel Chesney's promo video to become \"dated within 30 mins.\" Kēkā noted that \"costs are locked and consistent across all developers integrating it,\" making InVideo's unlimited offer particularly valuable. Winston Mayo asked \"Do we have Google and Deepmind people in this group because nano banana pro is so good?\" The community immediately began exploring use cases, with Rory Flynn demonstrating camera angle techniques using \"varying levels of tilt and horizontal rotation,\" which Martin LeBlanc praised as \"such a useful tip\" that \"nano banana pro is probably really good at.\" Ramon Guthrie inquired whether the Pro version \"fixed the pixel shift issue on small edits,\" highlighting ongoing refinements. PJ Accetturo created a Legend of Zelda movie trailer, joking that his friend who wrote the actual Zelda movie might either be impressed or upset. The launch represents a major advancement in AI image editing capabilities, with the Gemini 3 foundation providing significantly improved quality and control.",

          "description": "The community engaged in extensive discussion about Coca-Cola's latest AI-generated commercial, particularly focusing on the reported 70,000 generations used in production. Henry noted that \"70k feels more of an issue of hit rate than a flex - you gen more when the models don't deliver,\" questioning whether the high generation count represented inefficiency rather than thoroughness. Blvckl!ght observed that \"the sheer number of gens\" was the biggest pushback, as \"energy cost is the biggest factor for a lot of anti-AI people.\" Davide Bianca, who appeared to have inside knowledge, countered that \"it is still a lot less impact than an actual shoot\" and that the commercial \"tested through the roof\" according to System1 data. The discussion revealed tensions between creative control and brand requirements, with Noah noting that \"it's usually in their end when the quality starts to collapse\" due to brands being \"too slow to do notes, rush it all at the last minute\" leading to \"revision after revision.\" Blvckl!ght shared his approach: \"I have done a few music videos for some well known artists. The first iteration was their direction and it came out meh. But when I offered to redo the whole thing for free my way for comparison, they liked that better.\" Henry summarized the core issue: \"Always has been like this in any creative industry. Ego mostly.\" The conversation highlighted the complex dynamics of working with major brands on AI-generated content, where technical capabilities must navigate corporate processes, legal requirements, and stakeholder management.",

          "description": "Linus Ekenstam provided a masterclass in understanding enterprise brand costs, using a hypothetical Nike logo redesign to illustrate why major brand work commands massive budgets. He explained: \"I can draw the Nike Logo in 20 seconds, but the cost of changing the Nike Logo is astronomical, so if I were to redesign it, it would come at a cost close to $1bn even if I could re-draw it in 2 hours. Because Nike would price in risk.\" He detailed the actual costs: global tooling for printing and embossing, global digital asset management and distribution pipelines, industrial tooling for product manufacturing across multiple verticals, replacing millions of surfaces with existing logos, all physical stores, and immeasurable brand loss in having a new mark for people to connect with. \"This is just the very very tip of the iceberg. This is what Nike would pay for with a new logo, not the artist that would draw the new icon/wordmark, that would be the easiest part.\" Edmond Yang added that the comparison ignores \"process / idea / drafts / revisions\" and \"all the changes and battles you have to do as an agency with the client / brand.\" Sebastian Kamph humorously illustrated typical client revision requests: \"Now move the bottle and all logos 5cm to the left in all shots, but we love everything else... Btw, we changed our minds, now we want the previous edit, but keep the new changes with the bottle and logo. So merge the two please. We need it by EOD thanks!\" Linus responded: \"This is a human error - Creative Director without the ability to know what they want. If I work with people like this I always move away and never return.\" The discussion provided crucial context for understanding why AI tools, despite being faster and cheaper, don't automatically reduce costs for major brand work where risk management, legal processes, and stakeholder coordination dominate the budget.",
