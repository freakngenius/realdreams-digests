Google's Veo3 is built for professionals. Different goals, different end games.\"\n\nWhen Veo 3.1 went live in Google Flow, **PJ Accetturo** warned the community: \"Don't get suckered into all these API sites charging you $5 a clip.\" The release came with some technical specifications that sparked discussion - **Chris First** confirmed it \"renders at 720 and can upscale to 1080 on Flow,\" though **Jordan Daniel Chesney** noted disappointment about \"No 1080p for Veo 3.1.\" **Rourke** observed that Freepik was offering 1080p, suggesting they were using their own upscaler.\n\nInitial testing revealed unexpected issues. **Jordan** reported that \"music is on almost every gen\" and questioned if this was an intentional feature. The launch also experienced typical server strain, with users getting stuck at 99% generation progress and error messages stating \"This model is currently unavailable.\" **Chris First** noted that the main new feature appeared to be \"ingredients\" support, though **Rourke** clarified this wasn't actually new for Ultra Plan users who already had it on Veo 2.\n\nThere was significant confusion around fake Veo 3.1 API access. **Wavespeed** claimed to have Veo 3.1 API, which **Claire Xue** (who is with the Veo team) immediately debunked: \"No I'm with veo team now it's not out.\" **Jordan** questioned why they would make such a risky move: \"They're asking for a lawsuit it seems.\" **Max** and **Rourke** also identified suspicious Veo 3.1 clips that appeared to be stitched together with hidden cuts.",

So wasted 30 min waiting lol.\"\n\n**Chad Nelson** provided practical guidance: \"Pro is great for cinema visuals… but not needed for most other things.\" The remix feature drew criticism from **Noah**: \"Also remix is a pain in the ass to use. You have to know the videos code. But no watermark so… hooray?\"\n\nA major quality-of-life improvement arrived on October 11th when **Billy Boman** confirmed: \"Confirm NO watermark in Sora 2! (as in the Open AI interface).\" This was significant because, as **Billy** noted, \"all API was without watermark from the beginning - slightly unintuitive imo consider the Sora 2 price tag.\"\n\n**Higgsfield** made waves by claiming to offer \"Sora 2 Pro Max +\" which **Chris First** mocked: \"Oh you didn't get the CPP invite?😂😭 I'm already on Sora 17 Pro Max +.\" He speculated: \"Its probably Sora with an upscaler in the pipeline between API and user, but it should just say that.\" **Jordan Daniel Chesney** summed up community sentiment: \"Higgsfield should probably just say a lot. 😂\"",

It's basically 'good' marketing and announcing it at Zurich Film Festival in front of the right journalists.\"\n\n**Matthieu** expressed frustration with the attention it was receiving: \"It's just that no one wants this no one cares about this. And still everyone is speaking about this. Now they just made that AI crap famous and of course it will work. Because they know it will make headlines if in a film.\"\n\n**Danny Perkins** offered a contrasting perspective on how the RealDreams community should position itself: \"It's actually a case study on how not to do things...
